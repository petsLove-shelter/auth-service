# **🐶 🐱 🦊 Pets Love 🐭 🐹 🐰**

Pets Love is an app created with the goal of helping animal shelters, veterinarians, volunteers and all of those that wish to adopt a pet.

This app will help maintain a continuity of care for the animal after its adoption. The app will achieve this by providing a continuous flow of information from the professionals at the animal shelter. The information will include exact medical data and pictures of our animal friend. This will help keep a medical history of the animal and ensure its health and security.
